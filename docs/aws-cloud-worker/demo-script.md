# AWS cloud worker: presenter script

You present from Partner Demo - ViewOnly, signed in as a Field Kit persona. The operator commands run on the machine that holds the `demo-cloud-worker` checkout and AWS admin credentials. Each act below has the step, what is on screen, and the line to say. Times are from the rehearsal on 2026-10-02 and the golden run in ViewOnly.

Everything in this file is already registered: playbook `playbook-5f0883504230448eb024a2b3307625bd`, automation `aws-cloud-worker-dlq-alarm` (`auto-653e19610ae1473196526847c15665f0`), the EventBridge rule that posts to it, and tenant `cloud-worker`.

## Tabs to open before the audience arrives

| Tenant | https://t-cloud-worker.otterworks.app | nobody |
| Repository, demo branch | https://github.com/Cognition-Partner-Workshops/otterworks/tree/demo-cloud-worker | your GitHub login |

## Signing in as the persona

1. Open https://fieldkit.devin.ai and sign in with your magic link.
2. Open https://partner-workshops.devinenterprise.com/auth/login?redirect=/&reauth=true and choose "Log in with SSO". Field Kit shows a form with two dropdowns, `Area` and `Identity`. The `Identity` list changes with the `Area`.
3. Pick the pair from the table below and submit.
4. Land on the ViewOnly sessions list. If the page shows an org picker, choose Partner Demo - ViewOnly.

| Persona | Area dropdown | Identity dropdown | Devin user |
|---|---|---|---|
| AWS engineer (act 1 and 4) | ISV and platform | AWS | user-094334530455473bb8c587d207307833 |
| Cloud engineer (replies in act 2) | Platform and operations | Cloud Engineer | user-3f836342a33f4c759f0edeb2805d6b58 |
| Product manager (act 3) | Product, leadership and partner | Product Manager | user-f65e35477d3c403aaa0838632f20650b |

All three identities are Members of Partner Demo - ViewOnly already. To switch persona during the demo, sign out of partner-workshops first and repeat from step 2. The Field Kit cookie stays, so the magic link is not needed twice.

## Pre-flight, 30 minutes before

On the operator machine:

```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/repos/otterworks
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
git fetch origin && git checkout demo-cloud-worker && git pull
make cw-status
```

Expect: every pod `ready` except `admin-service` (its crash is a planted lab bug, leave it), `table live` equal to `table git`, queue and dlq at `0 visible`, alarm `OK, actions enabled`, `armed_at -`. Then confirm the image:

```bash
kubectl get deploy -n otterworks-cloud-worker notification-service -o jsonpath='{.spec.template.spec.containers[0].image}'
```

The printed tag should begin with `workshop-ep-contracts-2c2d7ff`, the golden image. If it names `demo-cw-...` instead, a run's fix image is still live and the alarm will not fire; run `make cw-apply` and check again. CD redeploys on every push to `demo-cloud-worker`, so do not push to the branch during the demo.

Check the automation tab shows `Active` and one past event at 100% success, and that the sessions list has no running session tagged `aws-cloud-worker`.

## Opening, 1 minute

Show: the tenant home page, then the CloudWatch dashboard with the DLQ at 0.

Say: "One team, one AWS account, and nobody has ten minutes. Watch Devin take the question, the page and the change."

## Act 1, ask, 4 minutes

Sign in as the AWS engineer, open a new session on repository `Cognition-Partner-Workshops/otterworks`, and paste:

```text
What runs in the demo tenant, how does a file share become a notification, and does the account match Terraform? Work from branch demo-cloud-worker and read .agents/skills/aws-cloud-worker/SKILL.md first.
```

Devin reads under the observer role and comes back with SNS `otterworks-cw-events` to SQS `otterworks-cw-notifications` to `notification-service` to DynamoDB `otterworks-cw-notifications`, the two IRSA roles, and the drift: the queue keeps messages for 14 days and Terraform says 4.

Say: "Devin read the account and the Terraform side by side, and found the drift before anyone ran a plan."

Leave this session open, because act 4 comes back to it, and start act 2 as soon as the session is working, so the alarm fires while Devin answers.

## Act 2, page, 14 minutes

On the operator machine, off camera:

```bash
make cw-arm
```

It points the consumer at a table that does not exist and publishes six `file_shared` events. Then the clock runs on its own:

| Minute from `cw-arm` | What happens | Show |
|---|---|---|
| 0 to 2 | consumer fails each message three times, SQS moves them to the DLQ | dashboard, DLQ depth climbing to 6 |
| about 3:45 | alarm `OK` to `ALARM`, EventBridge posts to the automation | alarm history; the automation tab's Events count goes up |
| plus 1 second | a session nobody typed appears, owner `automation-service`, tagged `aws-cloud-worker` | sessions list, open it |
| 2 to 3 | Devin posts the cause: live table `otterworks-cw-notifications-v2`, git says `otterworks-cw-notifications`, changed by hand in Helm | session transcript |
| 3 to 8 | `make cw-apply` under the builder role, DLQ redrive of 6, `make cw-verify EXPECT=after` 5/5, PR against `demo-cloud-worker` | session; the PR link |

While the DLQ is climbing, say: "Somebody changed a setting by hand last week. Nobody knows yet."

When the session appears, say: "Nobody started that. CloudWatch paged a Devin Automation the same way it would page a person."

When the cause is posted, say: "Devin found it in the telemetry before anyone filed a ticket."

When Devin has posted the restore, the redrive and the gate result, and the session is waiting, switch to the Cloud Engineer persona (or stay as the AWS engineer; either is a Member) and reply:

```text
Thanks, that matches what I saw in the Helm history. Keep the PR against demo-cloud-worker and leave cloudworker/ and eventing.env alone. Finish with the CloudTrail close (make cw-trail) so we have the record of what the observer read and what the builder changed, then post the summary and sign off.
```

Say: "Devin put git back in charge, replayed the lost notifications and proved it with a gate it cannot edit. The pull request makes sure a bad table name fails at boot next time."

Independent check, from the operator machine, any time after Devin says the gate passed:

```bash
make cw-verify EXPECT=after
```

The gate should print `PASS (5/5)`, and that number is yours to quote; the session's own gate output is its claim.

## Act 2, code-cause variant, 14 minutes

Use this instead of the act 2 above when the story is a bad release. The page, the alarm and the after gate are the same, but the config matches git, so Devin has to find the cause in code. Point the webhook at the code-cause Automation in `automation.md` first.

On the operator machine, off camera:

```bash
make cw-arm FAULT=parser
```

The tenant now runs the image built from release commit `14ca29e`, and six `file_shared` events go out. Rehearsal times are from 2026-10-05:

| Minute from `cw-arm` returning | What happens | Show |
|---|---|---|
| 0 to 1:30 | the parser rejects each message three times, SQS moves them to the DLQ | dashboard, DLQ depth climbing to 6 |
| about 4 | alarm `OK` to `ALARM`, EventBridge posts to the automation | alarm history |
| 4 to 7 | Devin finds the config equal to git, reads `Failed to parse SQS message` and the dead-letter bodies, and posts the cause: `SqsConsumer.kt` line 33, commit `14ca29e`, unknown key `Timestamp` in the SNS envelope, `folderId` in the event | session transcript |
| 7 onward | fix with a parser test, CD image, rollout under the builder role, redrive of 6, `make cw-verify EXPECT=after` 5/5 | session; the PR link |

While the DLQ is climbing, say: "The config is clean this time. Whatever broke shipped in the last release."

When the cause is posted, say: "Devin went from the alarm to the line and the commit that caused it, and showed the messages that line rejected."

When Devin has posted the fix, the redrive and the gate result, reply as the Cloud Engineer:

```text
That matches the release notes. Keep the PR against the release branch and leave cloudworker/ alone. Finish with the CloudTrail close (make cw-trail), then post the summary and sign off.
```

## Act 3, change, 6 minutes, optional

Sign in as the Product Manager, open a new session on the same repository, and paste:

```text
I'm the product manager for the OtterWorks admin dashboard in Cognition-Partner-Workshops/otterworks. On the dashboard overview, add a "Signed in today" tile with the number of users who signed in today, and add a "Last sign-in" column to the users table. Update the admin API docs for any admin endpoint you add or change. Deploy it somewhere I can open in a browser and send me the link. Work from the demo-cloud-worker branch, push to a new branch named demo-cw-<unix ts>-<slug>, and open the pull request against demo-cloud-worker, never main.
```

Act 3 ends when the PR carries Devin Review comments and CD has deployed the branch to `t-cw-<unix ts>-<slug>.demo.otterworks.app`. Open the link.

Say: "The person who knew what was needed asked for it directly, and the review and the deploy ran the way they run for your engineers."

Start act 3 right after the act 2 reply so its deploy finishes while you close.

## Act 4, close, 2 minutes

Back in the act 2 session, Devin's last message is the CloudTrail table. Reads are under `devin-cw-observer`, the redrive (`StartMessageMoveTask`) under `devin-cw-builder`, each with session name `devin-<session id>`. If the session has not posted it, run on the operator machine:

```bash
make cw-trail
```

CloudTrail can lag the call by several minutes, so this goes last.

Say: "Every call Devin made is in CloudTrail under a role you scoped and a session you can open."

## If something slips

- Alarm not in `ALARM` five minutes after `cw-arm`: `make cw-status`. DLQ above 0 and alarm `OK` means wait one more evaluation. DLQ at 0 means the consumer did not fail; check the image as in pre-flight, run `make cw-apply`, then `make cw-arm` again.
- Alarm in `ALARM` and no session after two minutes: open the automation tab's Events list. If the delivery failed, start a session by hand in ViewOnly with `!aws_cloud_worker` and the payload from `docs/aws-cloud-worker/automation.md` with `state` set to `ALARM`.
- Session stuck past minute 20: show the cause it posted and the open PR, then move to act 4.
- Devin asks a question you did not expect: answer as the Cloud Engineer in one line. It has the skill; it does not need commands from you.

## After the demo

```bash
make cw-reset
make cw-status
```

`cw-reset` restores the config and the baseline image, including after the parser variant, purges both queues, sets the alarm to `OK`, closes the `demo-cw-*` PRs and branches, drops the act 3 tenant and re-plants the retention drift. The status should read the same as pre-flight. Do not merge the fix PR; the baseline PR https://github.com/Cognition-Partner-Workshops/otterworks/pull/1793 is the one that merges into `main`.

## Rules for the run

- Never merge a `demo-cw-*` PR, and never open a PR against `main` during the demo.
- Leave `admin-service` alone; its crash loop belongs to another lab.
- Do not push to `demo-cloud-worker` while a run is live; CD would restart the consumer mid-session.
- The reader key and the builder role can change the tenant. Rotate them with `make cw-credentials` at the end of the cycle, or `make cw-teardown` when the demo retires.
