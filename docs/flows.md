## Mental Model

- **CRUD path**: API Gateway -> domain service -> primary datastore (synchronous, user-facing)
- **After-CRUD path**: domain event -> SNS/SQS -> search/notification/audit/analytics (asynchronous)
- **Collaboration path**: WebSocket + CRDT in collab-service, with persisted versions in document-service
