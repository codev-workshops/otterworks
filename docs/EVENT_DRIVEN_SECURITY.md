# Event-Driven Security Remediation Architecture

## Overview

OtterWorks uses an event-driven SAST pipeline where security findings detected
in pull requests are automatically routed to Devin for remediation. The pipeline
supports **two scanner paths** — Trivy (dependency CVEs) and SonarCloud (code
quality gate) — both feeding into the same Devin v3 API for autonomous fix
sessions. The pipeline runs without manual intervention for straightforward
fixes and escalates to human reviewers when automated remediation is
insufficient.

## Scanner Paths

### Path 1: Trivy (Dependency CVEs)

Triggered by `pull_request` events (`opened`, `synchronize`). Trivy scans the
full filesystem for known dependency vulnerabilities (HIGH and CRITICAL
severity). Results are parsed into a structured findings summary and included
in the Devin prompt.

- **Re-scan loop:** Devin's fix push fires a `synchronize` event → Trivy
  re-scans automatically.
- **Escalation:** After `MAX_FIX_ATTEMPTS` (default: 2) fix cycles, a GitHub
  Issue is opened for manual review.

### Path 2: SonarCloud (Code Quality Gate)

Triggered by `pull_request` events alongside the Trivy path. The workflow runs
the SonarCloud scanner via `SonarSource/sonarqube-scan-action` in CI, then
polls the SonarCloud API to check the quality gate status.

If the quality gate **fails** (status `ERROR`), the workflow triggers the Devin
webhook for a one-time remediation attempt.

This path is a **one-time remediation attempt** — if Devin has already posted
a fix comment on the PR, no additional sessions are created.

- **Re-scan loop:** Devin's fix push fires a `synchronize` event → SonarCloud
  re-scans in CI → if quality gate still fails, no new session (one-time).
- **Dashboard link:** The Devin prompt includes the SonarCloud dashboard URL
  for the specific PR.

## Bot-Loop Prevention

Both paths check `github.event.pull_request.user.login` against
`devin-ai-integration[bot]`. PRs opened
by Devin are never scanned by this workflow. For Devin's *commits* on
human-authored PRs, the `synchronize` event still fires but the author check
passes (it is the human's PR), so the re-scan runs — which is the desired
closed-loop behavior.

**Trivy path:** A secondary guard counts Devin's commits on the PR. If that
count reaches `MAX_FIX_ATTEMPTS` (default: 2), the pipeline stops triggering
Devin and escalates instead.

**SonarCloud path:** Concurrency group `sast-sonar-fix-{pr_number}` ensures
only one remediation session per PR. A comment-based check prevents
re-triggering after the first attempt.

## Escalation Policy

When automated remediation is exhausted (Trivy path only):

1. A GitHub Issue is created with the `security` and `needs-human-review` labels
2. The issue body contains the full findings summary
3. A PR comment notifies the developer that manual review is required

## Devin Automation Webhooks

Both paths trigger Devin sessions via **automation webhook endpoints**:

```
POST https://partner-workshops.devinenterprise.com/api/webhooks/automations/{ORG_ID}/{AUTOMATION_ID}
```

Request body includes:
- `source`: Scanner type (`trivy` or `sonarcloud`)
- `branch`: PR head branch
- `pr_number`: Pull request number
- `repository`: Full repo name (`owner/repo`)
- `findings_summary` (Trivy) or `sonarcloud_dashboard` (SonarCloud): Context

Required GitHub Actions secrets:
- `DEVIN_WEBHOOK_SECRET` — Webhook auth for Trivy automation
- `DEVIN_SONAR_WEBHOOK_SECRET` — Webhook auth for SonarCloud automation
- `SONAR_TOKEN` — SonarCloud API token for CI-based analysis

## Extending to Snyk

The pipeline is scanner-agnostic. To add Snyk as a third scanner path:

Replace the Trivy step with `snyk/actions/node@master` (or the appropriate
ecosystem action). Parse `snyk test --json` output for `severity` fields. The
Devin prompt structure, bot-loop prevention, and escalation logic remain
unchanged.
